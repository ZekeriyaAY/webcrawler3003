  <p>Wordpress is an <strong>open-source</strong> website builder. With Wordpress you can create blogs, e-commerce shops, landing pages and more&hellip; It has a marketplace for extensions and themes.</p>
<h3 id="is-it-really-open-source">Is it really open-source?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can find its <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress">github repo</a>. Open-source is its main feature. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s free. Also, it&rsquo;s written in PHP üêò</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-start-using-it">How can I start using it?</h3>
<p>You can start using Wordpress in two ways. The first one to go <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> and choose a plan for your needs. And the second one is to go <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/">wordpress.org</a> and download the latest version. And then find yourself a hosting provider to store your website. Also, you need to find a domain and connect it to your hosting. After all, you have to upload your Wordpress inside your hosting. And you&rsquo;re ready to run the installation. The process looks long, but it&rsquo;s not üôÇ</p>
<p>By the way, if you&rsquo;re thinking to host Wordpress on your own, check out my <a href="https://m.do.co/c/217fc00c5e4d">Digital Ocean</a> link üòâ</p>
<h3 id="some-useful-tips">Some useful tips</h3>
<p>In Wordpress you can download &amp; install a lot of free &amp; paid extensions. But you have to know, some extensions are slowing down your site. Also, if you have too many extensions, that also slows down your site.</p>
<p>Always keep your extensions, themes and Wordpress updated.</p>
<p>To find beautiful themes, I suggest <a href="https://themeforest.net/">themeforest.net</a>. They have tons of alternatives and different price points.</p>
