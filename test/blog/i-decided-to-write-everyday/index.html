  <p>After my finals ended I decided focus on my personal brand to create a community who love my work and want to see my work continue. After years what I learned from people who created unbreakable products &amp; things is, <strong>consistency &amp; patience</strong>. In order to make it happen I&rsquo;ll start to post on my blog every day. They all will not about programming. I&rsquo;m planning to write about design, business, life maybe space&hellip; That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s called personal blog 🙂</p>
