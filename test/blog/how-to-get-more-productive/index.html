<section class="post-content">
  <p>In today&rsquo;s world, getting distracted is super easy. Also, for a big chunk of young people, doing something is worthless. And I want to disagree with that. We&rsquo;re human because we can do whatever we want. We can build softwares, buildings, and new technologies. To move humanity forward, we have to do.</p>
<p>For myself, I&rsquo;m currently a student (btw, I don&rsquo;t like university education 😕), and because of the pandemic, we have online lessons. I don&rsquo;t have to go to school every day, and I don&rsquo;t have to go by bus with all the people on it. For me, things are going well, and I can code more, learn more and create more.</p>
<p>Ok, but how to create more?</p>
<p>Well, as I understood, you have to force yourself to create something every day. Currently, I&rsquo;m writing on my <a href="http://localhost:5500/i-decided-to-write-everyday/">blog</a> every morning, and I feel better. I started to post more on my social media accounts, and they&rsquo;re not food or travel photos. I&rsquo;m trying to showcase my work and create value for other people. As a result, I started to get more followers (you can check out the <a href="http://localhost:5500/contact/">contact</a> page to follow me 😉).</p>
<p>Try to find a place with productive people for me; I&rsquo;m traveling around <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">IndieHackers</a>, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a>, Twitter, and Instagram. For Twitter and Instagram, you have to limit yourself to specific people because a lot of people are just doing nothing, and your time is valuable, so be careful.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t care too much about what other people tell you. You know yourself better than anybody. Try new things to get more creative and be consistent.</p>
